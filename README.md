## We will use Netbeans for this workshop.
## Before you get started, please make sure you meet these three requirements:

1. Install the following plugin in Netbeans: NB Spring Boot
2. Create a  database for postgres using this command in the terminal. NOTE: make sure to change your username, in case it is not the default `postgres`.      
`createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres workshop`
  
3. Now you can pull this workshop. In your Netbeans project go to src/main/resources
   and change username/password in `application.properties` if they differ.
